## Document Organization and Hierarchies

You create logical structures using folders and pages. Nest documents to reflect your project's architecture, such as grouping API references under endpoints or tutorials under guides.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workspace] --> B[Projects]
    B --> C[API Docs]
    C --> D[Endpoints]
    D --> E[Users]
    B --> F[Tutorials]
    F --> G[Quickstart]
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder">
    Navigate to your workspace. Click the `+` button and select `New Folder`. Name it based on your project section, like `user-guides`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Nested Pages" icon="file-text">
    Inside the folder, create pages. Use the sidebar to drag and reorder for optimal hierarchy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Changes" icon="globe">
    Preview your structure, then publish to make it live for your team.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions, such as prefixes like `api-` or `tutorial-`, to enhance discoverability.
</Callout>

## Collaboration and Permissions

Invite team members and control access granularly. You assign roles like Editor, Viewer, or Admin to specific sections.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Editor Role" icon="edit-3">
    Editors modify content and reorganize hierarchies.
    
    | Permission | Allowed |
    |------------|---------|
    | Edit pages | Yes    |
    | Delete     | No     |
    | Publish    | Yes    |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Viewer Role" icon="eye">
    Viewers read but cannot alter documents.
    
    | Permission | Allowed |
    |------------|---------|
    | Edit pages | No     |
    | Delete     | No     |
    | Publish    | No     |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

To invite collaborators:

```javascript
// Example API call to add a user (via learn CLI)
await learn.inviteUser({
  email: "team@company.com",
  role: "editor",
  folderId: "proj-123"
});
```

## Version Control and History

Every edit creates a new version. You view diffs, restore previous states, and compare changes side-by-side.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,REST API">
  ```bash
  # View history for a page
  learn history get --page-id proj-123/docs/intro.mdx
  
  # Revert to version 5
  learn revert --page-id proj-123/docs/intro.mdx --version 5
  ```
  ```javascript
  // REST API example
  const history = await fetch('/api/pages/proj-123/docs/intro/history');
  const versions = await history.json();
  
  // Revert
  await fetch('/api/pages/proj-123/docs/intro/revert', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ version: 5 })
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="warning">
  Branching is available in Pro plans. Free users get linear history.
</Callout>

## Search and Discoverability

Search spans titles, content, and metadata. You filter by folder, tag, or date for precise results.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">
  Use operators like `tag:api` or `folder:projects` to refine queries.
  
  Example query: `"authentication" tag:security folder:api-docs`
  
  ```bash
  # CLI search
  learn search "REST API" --tag security --folder api-docs
  ```
</Expandable>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Tagging Best Practices">
    Apply tags consistently: `feature`, `bugfix`, `endpoint`. Limit to 5 per page.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Analytics Integration">
    Track popular searches to improve content structure.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>
