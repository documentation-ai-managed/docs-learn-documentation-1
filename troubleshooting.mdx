  <Step title="Check Browser Console" icon="bug">
    Open developer tools (`F12`) and look for errors like `401 Unauthorized`.

    ```javascript

    console.error("Failed to fetch /api/auth: 401");
    ```

## Page Editing Issues

Editing problems usually involve content limits or syntax errors in MDX.

<CodeGroup tabs="MDX,JSON">
  ```mdx
  <!-- Invalid: Unescaped special chars -->
  Use {variable} directly ❌

  <!-- Fixed -->
  Use `{variable}` ✅
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Parsing failed: Unexpected token {",
    "line": 42
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Advanced Editor Reset" default-open="false">
    Clear local storage:

    ```bash
    # In browser console
    localStorage.clear();
    location.reload();
    ```
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

## Collaboration Conflicts

Conflicts arise during simultaneous edits. Detect and resolve them promptly.

| Conflict Type | Symptom | Resolution |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Merge Conflict | Red highlights in editor | Accept current/incoming changes |
| Permission Denied | "Insufficient rights" error | Check workspace roles |
| Stale Data | Outdated preview | Pull latest: `git pull origin main` |

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always communicate with team members before major edits to avoid overlaps.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Resolve Merge" icon="git-merge">
    In the editor, select "Accept Yours" or "Accept Theirs" for each block.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rebase Locally" icon="git-branch">
    ```bash
    git fetch origin
    git rebase origin/main
    git push --force-with-lease
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Optimization

Slow loading? Optimize your workspace for better speed.

graph TD
    A[High Load] --> B[Clear Cache]
    B --> C[Reduce Images]
    C --> D[Enable Compression]
    D --> E[Fast Response]
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compress Images" icon="image">
    Use tools like TinyPNG before uploading. Limit to `<2MB` per image.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purge Unused Pages" icon="trash-2">
    Archive old drafts via Workspace Settings > Pages.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Caching" icon="database">
    In project settings, toggle "Browser Cache" to `true`.
  </Step>
</Steps>
